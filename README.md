# Basic-MIPS-Interpreter
This is a basic MIPS interpreter that I wrote in c++


The batch.s file is an example program that can be run with the MIPS interpreter. Other names can be used, just locate them in the Goodbye and Input 
functions and change them to your desired name of your .s file.

util.h is where my tokenizer is. It parses operations, registers, and labels to preform.

functions.h are where my mips functions are located.
